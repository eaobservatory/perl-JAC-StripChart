=head1 NAME

JAC::StripChart::Sink::AST - An AST-based stripchart

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use JAC::StripChart::Sink::AST;

  my $snk = new JAC::StripChart::Sink::AST( device => $dev );


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class handles the display of strip charts using a plot device
supported by AST. It does not need to know about sources of data
or how to create a display device. It only needs to know how to plot
the data being sent to it on the device that is registered with it.

=over 4

=item B<putData>

Plot the data on the registered device using AST as the plotting engine.

  $snk->putData( $chartid, $monid, $attr, @data );

=cut

sub putData {
  my $self = shift;
  my ($chartid, $monid, $attr, @data ) = @_;

  # First need to store the new data in the cache indexed by monid

  # then need to calculate statistics from the data for autoscaling
  my @x = map { $_->[0] } @data;
  my @y = map { $_->[1] } @data;

  my $xmax = max( @x );
  my $xmin = min( @x );
  my $ymax = max( @y );
  my $ymin = min( @y );

  # Select the correct subsection
  $self->device()->select;

  # now need to window the data

  # Create the AST plot and set the plotting attributes
  my $fr = new Starlink::AST::Frame( 2, "title=$chartid,label(1)=time,unit(2)=MJD,label(2)=flux,unit(2)=Jy" );

  my $plt = new Starlink::AST::Plot( $fr, [0,0,1,1], [$xmin,$ymin,$xmax,$ymax], "" );

  # Register the correct plotting engine callbacks
  $self->_grfselect( $plt );

  # draw the plot axes
  $plt->Grid();

  # plot the data using the requested attributes
  $plt->PolyCurve(\@x, \@y);

  # return and wait for more data
